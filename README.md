# 2D-landmark-based-Pose-Estimation

In this project, the input is a 2D image or video, and the output is a set of coordinates that represent the location of the landmarks on the object or person. These landmarks can include points such as joints, facial features, or other identifiable features that can be used to determine the pose.

The goal of this project is to accurately estimate the pose of a person in the image or video in real-time, 
which can have a wide range of applications in fields such as robotics, human-computer interaction. 
Some specific use cases include controlling virtual avatars with natural human gestures.
